## Get to safety

The object of the game is to guide the cats to safety by creating a path so they can reach the door. Create a score variable to keep track of how many cats reach the door.

--- task ---
Create a variable called `score`{:class="blockdata"}.

--- task ---
Add code to your cat sprite to add `1` to the `score`{:class="blockdata"} each time a cat reaches the door. Also set `score`{:class="blockdata"} to `0` `when the flag is clicked`{:class="blockevents"} at the start of the game.

`If`{:class="blockcontrol"} the cat is `touching the door sprite`{:class="blocksensing"}, then `add 1 to the score`{:class="blockdata"}.

Here are the new code blocks you need to add to your `when I start as a clone` script:

This is what your code should look like:

Add some more code so that, when a cat sprite reaches the door, the cat makes a 'meow' sound and then disappears.
